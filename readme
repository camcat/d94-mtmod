For Kathryn:

* I'm assuming header lines start with #. There can be more than one.
* I'm assuming column divider is " "
* Identifies lat/lon/dep/cmb by searching for the following strings in the header file: 'lat','lon','depth','coulomb'. If these are found somewhere else in the header file that could be a problem.
* no of points: 10^5+ will take a long time if we're also interested in the time dependence.
